About the job

AI/ML Solutions Architect – Distributed Training & GPU Infrastructure Location:

Remote from anywhere in the U.S and Canada.

Salary: Up to $240k base + 25% bonus + RSU




Join a fast-moving AI infrastructure team working on the cutting edge of large- scale ML workloads. This role is ideal for engineers who enjoy solving deep technical challenges in distributed training, multi-GPU systems, and scalable AI inference infrastructure. You'll work directly with AI-focused clients, helping them get the most out of modern GPUs (H100, B200, etc.) and ML frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow




Team & Responsibilities:

Work alongside world-class engineers building the infrastructure behind next- gen AI systems.




As part of the customer solutions team, you'll:

Design and deploy high-performance ML pipelines across hundreds/thousands of GPUs
Guide customers in optimizing distributed training and inference setups
Deliver tech talks, contribute to whitepapers, and gather feedback for product teams
Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, and R&D to shape our AI platform




Required Skills:

7+ years in ML infrastructure, MLOps, or similar roles
Deep experience with PyTorch, Tensorflow or JAX and multi-node training
Strong understanding of ML pipeline design, performance tuning, and deployment
Pre-sales experience
Kubernetes experience is a must
Nice to have: Slurm, Terraform, Helm
Programming in Python (Go, Java, or C++ a plus)




Bonus: Experience moving ML systems from POC to production-scale; familiarity with Hugging Face, TensorFlow, or inference optimization




We’re looking for hands-on engineers who understand real-world ML problems and love building scalable, robust systems. If you thrive at the intersection of infrastructure and AI, this is your next move.

Recruitment for your technology teams.

You don't need another agency flooding your inbox with mismatched candidates. You need senior recruiters who understand tech, challenge your thinking, and deliver candidates you didn't know how to reach.

At Doghouse, we operate like a tech company: fast, direct, and driven by solving problems, not hitting KPIs. No junior handovers. No sugarcoated updates. Just structured delivery sprints that keep you informed and in control.

What we do:

Permanent hiring
From medior engineers to principal-level specialists. We build high-performing product and engineering teams in roles that matter: engineering, data, DevOps, InfoSec. When we send someone, it's because they actually fit.

Executive search in tech:
Managing Director, CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Product. Leadership hires that shape the direction of your company. We know what separates a good leader from the right one for your context.

Interim & freelance
Mission-critical projects need top specialists, fast. We deliver experienced interim leaders and senior contractors who can hit the ground running.
Most clients wish they'd called us sooner. We're not here to flood your inbox. 

We're here to solve your hiring problem.
