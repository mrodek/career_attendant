Naming and File Conventions

* React Component Files: Must use PascalCase (e.g., UserCard.tsx).
* React Component Function Names: Must also use PascalCase (function UserCard()).
* Utility & Hook Files: Must use kebab-case (use-auth-hook.ts, date-utils.ts).
* Event Handlers: Must be prefixed with handle (e.g., handleClick()).
